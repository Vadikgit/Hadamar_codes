# Hadamar_codes

This project is an implementation and demonstration of the operation of a matrix algorithm for noise-resistant coding using the Hadamard method.

The Hadamard method allows you to correct a large number of errors during transmission due to the large redundancy of data.

As input, the algorithm takes a sequence of bits for encoding, the size of the unit blocks into which the sequence will be split, and the number of the bit in which the error will be artificially committed.

Input/Output of the program is carried out through the console or text files in accordance with the user's settings.

In the course of its work, the algorithm builds and outputs Hadamard matrices and displays the intermediate results of the coding process.

Next, the program makes an intentional error in the position specified by the user and decodes the resulting sequence, displaying intermediate results.
